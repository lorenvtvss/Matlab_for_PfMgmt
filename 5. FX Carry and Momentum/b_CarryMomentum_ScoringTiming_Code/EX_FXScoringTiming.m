% General: Extensions
% - 4 Strategies:
%       1 Long all foreign currencies, with total exposure of 1 always (EW)
%       2 Timed EW strategy: rescales the weights from strategy (1) using 
%         the ratio 20/VIX (VIX level at time of construction)
%       3 Scoring strategy: long currencies with a positive overall score 
%         and short those with a negative overall score, 
%         with total long and short exposures of 1 and -1 always
%         -> Score 1: top and bottom 3 currencies at end of each month 
%                     based on the level of interest rates get a carry score 
%                     of +1 and â€“1
%         -> Score 2: same for momentum
%       4 Scoring timed strategy: rescales the weights from strategy (3) 
%         using the ratio 20/VIX (VIX level at time of construction)
